<p>Hi, my name is Amit. Looking for different opportunities and way of thinking is really different. Ideas don't know what tries to speak but really they are awesome.</p>
<p>Topics are more and more, alot to discuss, to say, to work, to be silly, to passionate, to be sarcastic, to be outspoken, to feel, to discard, to .... a lot more man... All the time being scitific, degnified, respected, precise etc hurts pokes... so choices is yours.. </p>

<p>And you have to <i>choose</i> a gift for me.</p>
